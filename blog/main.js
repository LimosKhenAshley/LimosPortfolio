                <div class="modal-text">
                    <p>As someone deeply interested in solving real-world problems through software, I wanted to create a system that not only sharpened my skills but also addressed genuine community needs. That’s when the idea of <strong>CommUnityHub</strong> was born—a centralized platform to digitize and streamline barangay operations.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Vision</h2>
                    <p>The inspiration came from observing how many local barangays still rely on manual logs, handwritten certificates, and scattered documentation. I envisioned <strong>CommUnityHub</strong> as a smart barangay management system—one that could help barangay officials manage residents, issue documents, track payments, generate reports, and more, all in one place.</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1366266940/vector/city-hall-vector-building.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=GCJlmEJ8NQYDf3uIfPizKhOk2TCBDmDkSQ9_zRWNdcI=" alt="Baranagay Image" style="width: 100%; max-height: 300px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 4px; margin: 15px 0;">
                    
                    <h2>Laying the Foundation</h2>
                    <p>I chose <strong>.NET MAUI</strong> for its cross-platform capabilities, enabling the system to run on both Windows and Android, with future scalability in mind. I connected the application to a <strong>SQL database</strong>, ensuring data persistence and structured storage. From the very start, I made design decisions such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using a ContentPage structure for modular, maintainable pages.</li>
                        <li>Implementing a login system with roles (e.g., Super Admin, Barangay Secretary) to control access and permissions.</li>
                        <li>Displaying user-specific dashboards with dynamic data like document counts, recent activities, and resident demographics.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>Resident Management & Search Functionality</h2>
                    <p>One of the core features was <strong>Resident Management</strong>. I built a searchable, paginated list where officials can add, edit, or remove residents. The search could filter residents by first name, middle initial, last name, or ID. The data model included demographic details like gender, civil status, age, and contact information.</p>

                    <h2>Document Generation</h2>
                    <p>CommUnityHub automates the creation of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Certificate of Residency</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Barangay Clearance</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Business Permits</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Barangay Ordinances</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Instead of filling out forms manually, officials select a resident, and the system autofills their data into a <strong>PDF document</strong>. I chose <strong>PDFSharp</strong> to generate these documents, keeping the system lightweight and license-free. Each document has its own table in the database, storing resident names and a binary copy of the generated PDF for record-keeping and later retrieval.</p>

                    <h2>Payment Processing</h2>
                    <p>I added a <strong>Payment Processing Page</strong> where users could track payments for document processing. The system records:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Document Name</li>
                        <li>Payment Amount</li>
                        <li>Due Date</li>
                        <li>Payment Status (Paid, Unpaid)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This allows transparency and helps the barangay maintain accountability.</p>

                    <h2>Dashboards, Reports, and Charts</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>DashBoardPage</strong> acts as the main hub after login. It features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Real-time</strong> stats for total residents and document summaries</li>
                        <li><strong>Charts</strong> showing gender and age group distribution (using a free NuGet charting library)</li>
                        <li><strong>Recent activities</strong> such as logins, document creations, and updates</li>
                        <li><strong>Barangay officials</strong> listed with hardcoded values in XAML for simplicity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Later, I added a <strong>report generation tool</strong> to track daily, monthly, and yearly transactions, helping prepare for compliance reports like those for the Commission on Audit.</p>

                    <h2>Events & Emergency Hotlines</h2>
                    <p>To make the app more community-centric, I included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>calendar view</strong> (via a free NuGet package) to manage barangay events</li>
                        <li>An <strong>emergency hotline section</strong> for residents to see and message local authorities during crises</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These features aim to foster community engagement and ensure residents have quick access to essential services.</p>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>User Profiles and Logs</h2>
                    <p>Each user has a profile page showing their information and allowing updates. I implemented user logging for every login and activity—useful for transparency and audits. I centralized the logging function so it could be reused across the app.</p>

                    <h2>Offline-Ready and Future-Proof</h2>
                    <p>Understanding that barangays may have limited internet access, I designed CommUnityHub to <strong>work fully offline</strong>, syncing only when needed. I also used patterns like <strong>Singleton</strong> for managing user sessions and ensuring efficiency throughout the app.</p>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>
                    <p>Some challenges I tackled along the way:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preventing document issuance for residents with blotter records</li>
                        <li>Creating a consistent UI across pages</li>
                        <li>Managing performance as the resident list grew (hence, pagination)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I learned how to work with <strong>PDF generation, role-based UI control, data binding</strong>, and even UI/UX principles to make the app intuitive for non-technical users.</p>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>CommUnityHub isn’t just a school project or portfolio piece—it's a vision for how local governance can embrace technology. It taught me to think like a developer, designer, and problem-solver all at once. This project deepened my understanding of how technology can directly impact communities. And as I continue to improve it, I hope CommUnityHub becomes a tool that more barangays can benefit from.</p>

                <div class="modal-text">
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a buzzword for years, but its recent advancements have sparked both excitement and fear. Many people worry that AI will take over jobs, make decisions for us, or even become uncontrollable. But what if I told you that AI is not the problem? The real issue lies in how we use it.</p>
                    <p>As a software developer, I see AI as a powerful tool that can enhance our capabilities, not replace them. The key is to understand that AI is just a tool—like a hammer or a computer. It’s how we wield it that determines its impact.</p>
                    
                    <h2>AI as a Tool, Not a Threat</h2>
                    <p>Think about it: a hammer can build a house or destroy one. Similarly, AI can be used for good or ill, depending on our intentions. The real question is: how are we using AI?</p>
                    <p>In my experience, AI can automate mundane tasks, analyze vast amounts of data, and even assist in creative processes. For example, AI can help developers write code faster by suggesting snippets or debugging issues. It can also analyze user behavior to improve software usability.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Misuse of AI</h2>
                    <p>However, the misuse of AI is where the real danger lies. When we rely on AI to make decisions without human oversight, we risk creating systems that are biased, opaque, or even harmful. For instance, using AI to screen job applicants can perpetuate existing biases if the training data is flawed.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bias in AI:</strong> If AI systems are trained on biased data, they will produce biased outcomes. This can lead to unfair treatment of individuals based</li>
                        <li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> AI systems often require vast amounts of data, raising concerns about user privacy. If not handled properly, sensitive information can be exposed or misused.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> Many AI algorithms are "black boxes," meaning we don't fully understand how they make decisions. This can lead to mistrust and fear.</li>
                        <li><strong>Over-reliance on AI:</strong> Relying too heavily on AI can lead to a loss of critical thinking skills. If we let AI make decisions for us, we risk becoming passive consumers of technology.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These issues highlight the importance of responsible AI development and usage. As developers, we must ensure that AI systems are transparent, fair, and accountable.</p>

                    <p class="image-caption">AI in Good Use</p>
                    
                    <h2>Embracing AI Responsibly</h2>
                    <p>To harness the power of AI without falling into its traps, we need to embrace it responsibly. Here are some principles to guide us:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Human Oversight:</strong> Always have a human in the loop. AI should assist, not replace, human judgment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Strive for transparency in AI algorithms. Understand how they work and ensure they can be explained to users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> Consider the ethical implications of AI applications. Ensure they align with societal values and do not harm individuals or communities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Stay informed about AI advancements and their implications. As technology evolves, so should our understanding of its impact.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By following these principles, we can use AI to enhance our lives and work without falling prey to its potential pitfalls.</p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>AI is not a threat; it’s a tool that can empower us if used wisely. As developers and users, we have the responsibility to shape AI in ways that benefit society. By embracing AI with caution and ethical considerations, we can unlock its full potential while minimizing risks.</p>
                    <p>Let’s not fear AI; let’s learn to use it responsibly. After all, the future of AI is in our hands.</p>

                    <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
                    <p>College has been a journey of self-discovery. I've learned to step out of my comfort zone, whether it was giving presentations, participating in debates, or leading group projects. These experiences have boosted my confidence and helped me develop leadership skills.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Overcoming stage fright during presentations</li>
                        <li>Learning to accept constructive criticism</li>
                        <li>Setting and achieving personal goals</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I've also learned the importance of self-care and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. College can be demanding, but taking time for myself has been crucial for my well-being.</p>


                    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
                    <p>As I approach graduation, I feel a mix of excitement and anxiety about the future. College has prepared me for the real world, but the uncertainty ahead is daunting. However, I am confident that the skills and experiences I've gained will guide me through whatever comes next.</p>
